# CIS 3515 Assignment 7 (Kotlin Fragments)
The purpose of this lab is to create a new application called AudioBookPlayer, that will incorporate a dynamic
(responsive) user interface UI, that will display a **SINGLE FRAGMENT** at a time if the application is being run
in **portrait mode,** but must display **TWO FRAGMENTS** at a time if the being run in **landscape mode.**

This project is being compiled and tested using the Pixel 3 XL API 30 phone

## Part 1: The Recycler View
This application will contain a list of book items, held inside a RecyclerView, similar to the previous lab, however
this project will incorporate the use of **fragments** to manipulate the data displayed. For the first part, the 
RecyclerView needs to be created, and running properly, with a list of books.
